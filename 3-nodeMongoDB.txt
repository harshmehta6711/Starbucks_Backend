Steps to create 3-node MongoDB cluster.

Here one node serves as primary node where write operations are perfomed. Other node serves as secondary node where read operations are performed. The data are replicated in both the nodes. This makes the backend more scalable and reliable and handles the incoming requests.

The third node serves as the arbitrator and converts the secondary node to primary node when the primary node is down and cannot take the incoming request anymore.

Here we make 3-node mongodb cluster on 3 ubuntu 16.0 EC2 instances in AWS.

run the following commands on all the instances: 

sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add noatime directly after defaults,.

LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs   /        ext4   defaults,noatime        0 0


##Setup MongoDB on each Server

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu "$(lsb_release -sc)"/mongodb-org/3.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.2.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org


Stop the mongod server for a while.

sudo service mongod stop

##Modify the hosts on each Server Modify the hosts file on each server. Obviously on mongo1 the 127.0.0.1 will point at localhost mongo1.example.com

sudo nano /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1           localhost mongo0.example.com
52.51.12.62         mongo0.example.com
52.18.54.237        mongo1.example.com
52.40.234.42        mongo2.example.com

##Modify the hostname on each Server To make it easier, it is best to modify the hostname to make the servers easier to reference. First set the current hostname.

sudo hostname mongo0.example.com

Then update the hostname file to set the server name permanently.

sudo nano /etc/hostname

Set the hostname in the file to:

mongo0.example.com

##Modify the Mongo Configuration You need to modify the mongo configuration /etc/mongod.conf to first remove or comment out the bind_ip. This will tell mongo to listen on all interfaces.

# mongod.conf
